        While youâ€™re adjusting to your new environment, it is natural to experience Culture Shock, which is a feeling of disorientation when abruptly subjected to a foreign way of life. There are 4 phases to Culture Shock: Honeymoon, Anxiety, Adjustment, and finally Acceptance. During this period, you may experience symptoms such as feelings of helplessness and withdrawal.

            I often feel lonely, but I have my problem is that the people I can hang with don't work too often and play games too much. And I don't know if I'm like a workaholic, but I tend to isolate myself after a period into the school year because I like to focused and be reserved. Most of the times I think it's because I'm not with my family, I dont have a home here, and I'm surrounded my various versions of myself and I dont like that. Usually by mid term I'd have grown sick of people's surrounding me everyday and everywhere. I think it's terrifying. University is a weird place and dormitory is a weird phenomenon. The many failed attempts to assimilate has brought me to believe I don't belong and often I feel sad about it. I just work on my stuff a lot to be emotionally stable. It's not healthy, but you know, you just do.

            The language barrier became an issue for me freshman and sophomore years. The american slang has a huge influence in social interaction and the conversations happen quick and snap. When you are thrown out of it by a word as an international you experience a very concrete discomfort. I was personally not very upforward at these situations in the beginning of my experience in risd(in us in general). therefor there were times when i lost connection in a conversation or was basicly thrown out of an ongoing one among friends and was even mocked about while i was present in the place (this took place in brown actually) out of these experiences i learned my lesson that i actually just had to ask stuff like words, sayings, phrases straight up so that i could just basically learn and gain a linguistic competence.

            Found it difficult to verbally articulate my thoughts in conversations, leading to a dip in confidence, and struggle to form bonds. Still working on overcoming it, I found that it helps when classmates understand what's going on, instead of keeping it to self.

            Mostly seeing how open people are open to their sexuality and expression of gender identity that surprises me since it's a sensitive subject for me somewhat, and while seeking religion to understand the other-side of things but ultimately finding more conflict of sorts.

            It was very tough first I got here. It was hard to make really close friend and blend into others. I force my self really hard to social everyday, but I am not actually an extroverted person. I push myself too hard, and I can't get good rest. I gave myself a lot of pressure. I always want to get A as a way to prove my hard work. If professor don't like my work , I would be really upset and blame myself for not working hard enough. However, now I realize that I am doing artwork for myself, even its for customer, I should still have my own voices in it. My aim should not be satisfying everybody, but myself. I realized that I am still in the process of study, and probably will be forever . Giving myself too much pressure and judging my work based on professors opinion often leads to negative mood. I was super frustrated once because my freshman professor don't like my working style and thought I was wrong. It turns out that I am doing well now in my department and I feel more comfortable too.

            <p>The biggest emotional issue I've had at RISD is missing home and talking to my friends and family on a regular basis. I eventually overcame this by simply calling up my friends and family and keeping in touch with them regularly; although it was very hard in the beginning, I eventually found my place in RISD by meeting a good group of friends which allowed me to build a good support system here at RISD.</p>
        </div> RISD Public Safety, Residence Life, the Office of International Student Services (OISS), as well as Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) are also great sources of help; donâ€™t be afraid to approach them with any query or need. With patience and guidance, you will overcome many problems and gain valuable experience to move forward in college.
