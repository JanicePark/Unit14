        While you’re adjusting to your new environment, it is natural to experience Culture Shock, which is a feeling of disorientation when abruptly subjected to a foreign way of life. There are 4 phases to Culture Shock: Honeymoon, Anxiety, Adjustment, and finally Acceptance. During this period, you may experience symptoms such as feelings of helplessness and withdrawal, (Blanket icon - Val) mood swings, disrupted sleep patterns, homesickness (Juice box icon - Kirt), getting stuck in routines, and even hostility towards host nationals (Stop sign icon - Volf). Many students are emotionally attached to events back home (TV icon - Angel) and feelings of loneliness can be triggered by a sense of dissociation from cultural customs, food, and festivals (Flower icon - Shivangi). Depending on your background, you may also feel frustrated with language barriers (Wall icon - Yasemin) on top of adjusting to the habits of American social interaction. Some things can only be learned the hard way through courage and practice (Microphone icon - Priscilla), but you should always give yourself time and have faith in your progress.

        Unfortunately, the intense studio culture at RISD is quite unforgiving, and college life comes with its own unique set of problems. For instance, you may encounter relationship issues (Broken heart icon - Ishaan), question your identity (Speech dialog or Spotlight icon - William Su), feel pressurized by work (Thermometer icon - T.), be constantly sleep-deprived (Pillow icon - Hazel), and get into disagreements with your professors (Hammer icon - Syrena). Unexpected emergencies are also a part of life and can be unnerving to handle for the first time (Alarm bell icon - Haejung). The best way to deal with these is to find a strong group of friends who can offer support, and keeping in touch with friends and family back home also helps alleviate emotional stress (Telephone icon - Javier). RISD Public Safety, Residence Life, the Office of International Student Services (OISS), as well as Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) are also great sources of help; don’t be afraid to approach them with any query or need. With patience and guidance, you will overcome many problems and gain valuable experience to move forward in college.
