        While the process may seem daunting and it is natural to feel frustrated, don’t stress out too much about it! Start early, give the applications ample time, and anticipate unexpected events so that the process runs smoothly. If you’re confused, check in with the OISS at Carr Haus and feel free to talk to your seniors! Many of them are international and have overcome the same issues. Working in the United States is an enriching experience and adds a colorful chapter to your college life as an international student. Good luck!
